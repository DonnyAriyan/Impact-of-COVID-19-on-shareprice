                <h2> What is the effect of COVID-19 on a global scale?</h2>
                <p>It is undeniable that <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19 </span> pandemic had presented us with
                    <br>
                    new challenges such as not only <b>social
                        disruption</b> but also <br> as a <b>profound risk </b>to the health and growth economies <br>
                    of countries the
                    globe.
                    This can be measured by Gross <br> Domestic Product per capita or <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                        GDP-per-capita </span> which, in
                    short, refers to the <br> <b>overall
                        health</b> of the economy of a particular country, measured <br> by the total monetary value of
                    all

                    goods

                <h2> Which countries were most affected in the year, in terms of GDP per capita, by the COVID-19? </h2>
                <p>Here, we have compiled the top 5 countries most affected by COVID-19 in the year, 2020; The Bahamas,
                    Lebanon, etc. When comparing percentage (%) change values from the heatmap for the exact same 5
                    countries for the previous year, 2019, we can see that, for example, Maldives was experiencing a
                    6.9% increase in its GDP per capita when compared to 2018 however, when looking at its 2020 GDP per
                    capita we can observe a significant slump in its GDP per capita from 6.9% to -33.5%, this is a 40.4%
                    difference. Looking at a GDP per capita of -33.5% individually is already shocking. This means that
                    there is, on average, a 33.5% decrease in the economic output per person in Maldives.</p>

                <h2> What is the difference in these 5 countries' GDP per capita from the previous year, 2019?</h2>
                When looking within the scope of the GDP per capita percentage (%) change we can deduce that although
                some of these countries were already experiencing declines in GDP per capita growth, it is quite
                unanimous that these declines in GDP per capita are very trivial compared to the values in 2020,
                reaching unprecedented levels, for example, Macao experiencing a -54% decline. It is true and important
                to note that although COVID-19 does explain a large extent it does not explain the full extent of this
                decrease as there are a multitude of other external factors such as government intervention via policy
                implementation or change.

        <p> Through observing Figure 1, we are able to interpret that in the year, 2020, the economy on a global scale
            was profoundly impacted by COVID-19 where many economies faced a huge downturn ultimately, having
            implications of economic turmoil and decreased productivity. We are also able to deduce that even the
            COVID-19 pandemic first surfaced in late 2018, economies began to suffer the full effects in 2020 where
            majority of the countries experienced negative percentage (%) change in GDP per capita (denoted by countries
            that are
            red in colour) except for Guyana which experienced a 43.5% increase in its GDP per capita relative to the
            previous
            year, 2019. </p>

            <div class="column right">
                <p class="indebt">Here, we aim to find if there is any form <br> of <b>correlation</b> between the
                    percentage (%) change in GDP per
                    capita in 2019 between that in 2020, which can be achieved by filtering countries experiencing
                    increases in GDP per capita in both years, 2019 and 2020. From observation, we can extrapolate that,
                    in 2019, majority of the countries experienced a percentage change of 7% or below however, when
                    looking from the percentage change of GDP per capita from 2020, we can see that many countries
                    experienced a GDP per capita change, in percentage, of less than 5% with one country, the Congo,
                    experiencing an approximate 43% change which is an outlier. Hence, on average, out of the countries
                    that experienced an increase in GDP per capita for both years, there is significantly less of an
                    increase in that percentage change in GDP per capita in the year of 2020 relative to 2019, with the
                    majority experiencing declines in GDP per capita, which are filtered out of this idiom.</p>

                <p> In this idiom, the five most COVID-19 affected countries have been regressed with the five least
                    COVID-19 affected countries, these countries are regressed against their very own, exact GDP per
                    capita for the year, 2020. Here, we can observe that the aggregate difference between the total in
                    GDP per capita decreases heavily exceeds the total in the GDP per capita increases (in the top 5
                    countries that have experienced a positive GDP per capita growth in 2020). From this, we can
                    conclude that COVID-19 was indeed a large factor in play in the economic crisis and turmoil that
                    unfolded causing economies to slump and markets to crash.</p>
