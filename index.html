                <p>It is undeniable that <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19 </span> pandemic had presented us with

                    new challenges such as not only <b>social
                        disruption</b> but also as a <b>profound risk </b>to the health and growth economies
                    of countries the
                    globe.
                    This can be measured by Gross Domestic Product per capita or <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                        GDP-per-capita </span> which, in
                    short, refers to the <b>overall
                        health</b> of the economy of a particular country, measured by the total monetary value of

                        GDP-per-capita </span>, by the <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19 </span>? </h2>
                <p>Here, we have compiled the top 5 countries most affected by <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19
                    </span> in the year, 2020; The Bahamas,
                    Lebanon, etc. When comparing percentage (%) change values from the heatmap for the exact same 5
                    countries for the previous year, 2019, we can see that, for example, Maldives was experiencing a
                    6.9% increase in its <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                        GDP-per-capita </span> when compared to 2018 however, when looking at its 2020 <span

                        GDP-per-capita </span> we can observe a significant slump in its <span

                        GDP-per-capita </span> from 6.9% to -33.5%, this is a 40.4%
                    difference. Looking at a <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                        GDP-per-capita </span> of -33.5% individually is already shocking. This means that
                    there is, on average, a 33.5% decrease in the economic output per person in Maldives.</p>

                When looking within the scope of the <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                    GDP-per-capita </span> percentage (%) change we can deduce that although
                some of these countries were already experiencing declines in <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                    GDP-per-capita </span> growth, it is quite
                unanimous that these declines in <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                    GDP-per-capita </span> are very trivial compared to the values in 2020,
                reaching unprecedented levels, for example, Macao experiencing a -54% decline. It is true and important
                to note that although <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19 </span> does explain a large extent it does
                not explain the full extent of this
                decrease as there are a multitude of other external factors such as government intervention via policy
                implementation or change.

        <p> Through observing Figure 1, we are able to interpret that in the year, 2020, the economy on a global scale
            was profoundly impacted by <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19 </span> where many economies faced a huge
            downturn ultimately, having
            implications of economic turmoil and decreased productivity. We are also able to deduce that even the
            <span class='COVID-19_text'> COVID-19 </span> pandemic first surfaced in late 2018, economies began to
            suffer the full effects in 2020 where
            majority of the countries experienced negative percentage (%) change in <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>

                        GDP-per-capita </span> in 2019 between that in 2020, which can be achieved by filtering
                    countries experiencing

                        GDP-per-capita </span> in both years, 2019 and 2020. From observation, we can extrapolate that,
                    in 2019, majority of the countries experienced a percentage change of 7% or below however, when
                    looking from the percentage change of <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                        GDP-per-capita </span> from 2020, we can see that many countries

                        GDP-per-capita </span> change, in percentage, of less than 5% with one country, the Congo,
                    experiencing an approximate 43% change which is an outlier. Hence, on average, out of the countries

                        GDP-per-capita </span> for both years, there is significantly less of an
                    increase in that percentage change in <span class='GDP-per-capita_text'>
                        GDP-per-capita </span> in the year of 2020 relative to 2019, with the
